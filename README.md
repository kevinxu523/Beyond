# BEYOND- YOUR ONE STOP WEB-APP FOR INTERGALACTIC TRAVEL
# Inspiration
The idea of space travel always feels fascinating. NASA's recent project(Perseverance Rover)which took human names to Mars and also issued boarding passes for fellow humans initiating loads of hope and curiosity was the inspiration for this web-app
# What it does
This website is for booking tickets for exoplanet travel.
Users can choose their starting location from one of the spaceport options and decide their location as well as book their seats on various rocket options available.
# How we built it
Used Balsamiq for making initial wire frames and designing and built the web-app using React framework with some teamwork
# Challenges we ran into
There were no sufficient APIs available related to names of exoplanet,spaceship images or generation of tickets .
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We also managed to deploy the web-app within 36 hours of hacking time.
# What we learned
Learnt about React and more about how the framework works.
Learnt more about Space travel and about existing planets and exoplanets in the universe. 
# What's next for Beyond
We would like to expand our web-app to more spaceports, to more parts of the universe, various other planets and ultimately achieve something BEYOND human thinking could.
